# Web_crawler



This repository is used for storing my python-based web crawler projects. These projects are fairly simple and easy to follow. 



Most of these projects are mainly used for the studing of some basic network requests modules in python, while some others may serve specific functional purposes.



`Function modules`

1. python requests 
2. python selenium 
3. python scrapy
4. (on the way) python scraapy-redis



`Functional purposes`

1. http ip pool 
2. 12306 ticket buying
